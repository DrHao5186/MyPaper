As we all know, breast cancer is one of the 
important causes that endanger womenâ€™s health. 
And screening mammography has become a 
technology that can effectively control 
breast cancer. 
It is necessary to build 
mammography image recognition systems. 
Previous solutions for mammography image 
recognition are usually based on hand-crafted 
features methods and use but limited in 
specific situations. 
Also, some methods utilize simple deep 
learning network, which can not achieve a 
good recognition effect.
In this paper, we propose a deep learning based 
approach with multiple feature fusion transfer 
learning strategy. Firstly, we obtain the 
training data from an open data set called 
DDSM images. 
Then we employ data augment methods, and 
train a novel deep neural network to detect 
lesions and conduct the object detection job. 
Pre-trained model is used to initialize the 
network and help extract the basic features.
Furthermore, we propose a fusion method that 
makes use of multiple transfer learning models 
in inference. 
Importantly, we take a strategy applied by hash 
learning in the deep network is cited to 
enhance the generalization ability of the 
model and solve the challenge of 
high-dimensional calculation in deep learning. 
In the end, regression analysis to analyze 
the object position. 
The experimental results prove that our method 
achieves high accuracy on the mammography image 
object detection and inspection task.
