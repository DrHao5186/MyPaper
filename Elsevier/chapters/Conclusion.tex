\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conc}

In this paper, a deep convolutional neural 
network for mammography images object detection 
task, which employing the strategy of combining 
multiple model fusion transfer and transfer 
learning to improve the classification accuracy. 
Taking advantage of multiple modelsâ€™ 
representation power, the proposal achieves a 
higher accuracy than merely a single model. 
Meanwhile, the strategy applied by hash 
learning in the deep network is cited to 
enhance the generalization ability of the 
model and solve the challenge of 
high-dimensional calculation in deep learning.
In the experiments, it's found that classifying 
images based on CNN relies heavily on the 
quantity and breadth of the training data set. 
Our network is still not efficient enough to 
cover every situation of mammography diagnosed. 
In the future, we plan to collect a larger 
data set with more detailed labels and build 
a more effective architecture to further 
improve the performance of the mammography 
image object detection.
